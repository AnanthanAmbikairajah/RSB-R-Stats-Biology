In this workshop we will discuss and practice with:

* Why to use model selection
* Model selection based on step-wise versus information criteria
* How to apply information criteria based model selection in R
* Why model selection does not mix well with p-values

**Location:** DNA meeting room (S104) Robertson Building, RSB, Building #46

**Date:** Friday, 31st May 2019

**Time:** 10:00am to 12:00pm

**Equipment:** Please bring a laptop with a recent version of R installed. I recommend you use R-Studio, but that is not essential.


Everybody is welcome. There are no strict prerequisites but I will assume everybody has some basic knowledge of R: load data, use objects and functions; please contact me beforehand if you are new to R so that I can introduce you to the basics.
