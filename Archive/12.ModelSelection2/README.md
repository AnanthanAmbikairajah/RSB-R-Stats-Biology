Download the workshop material at [https://timotheenivalis.github.io/RSB-R-Stats-Biology/Archive/12.ModelSelection2/SlidesData.zip](https://timotheenivalis.github.io/RSB-R-Stats-Biology/Archive/12.ModelSelection2/SlidesData.zip).

In this workshop we will discuss and practice with:

* How to obtain different information criteria in R
* How to automate model selection
* How to use model selection to choose between conflicting hypotheses
* Why model selection does not mix well with p-values

**Location:** DNA meeting room (S104) Robertson Building, RSB, Building #46

**Date:** Friday, 14th June 2019

**Time:** 10:00am to 12:00pm

**Equipment:** Please bring a laptop with a recent version of R installed. I recommend you use R-Studio, but that is not essential.


Everybody is welcome. There are no strict prerequisites but I will assume everybody has some basic knowledge of R: load data, use objects and functions; please contact me beforehand if you are new to R so that I can introduce you to the basics. In addition, this time I will not re-explain from scratch the principles of model selection.
