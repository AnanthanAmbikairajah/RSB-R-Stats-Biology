The HDR Career Development Framework was launched late 2018 to assist HDR students in the Joint Colleges of Science, Health and Medicine to develop, and get recognition for, a broad range of academic and work-relevant skills.

The framework covers four tracks (Research; Teaching and Learning; Policy and Governance; Industry and Innovation) with students needing to provide evidence of completion in at least two tracks.

Activities (workshops, courses, MOOCs, publications, leadership roles etc.) are assigned Career Development Skill (CDS) points. Students must gain at least 30 CDS points across two tracks, with a minimum of 10 points in each track.

Upon completion a “Certificate of Completion” will be provided for students to present to future employers.

To log into the Career Development Framework please go to: https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au – select COSCDP.
