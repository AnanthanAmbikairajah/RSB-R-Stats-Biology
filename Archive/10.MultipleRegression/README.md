# Multiple regression

Coefficients from a multiple regression do not have the same meaning as coefficients from a simple regression (that is, a linear model with a single predictor). However the difference is sometimes overlooked, which leads to wrong interpretations, misconceptions about inexistent problems (along with purported solutions that them do create real problems). Today we will try to understand what modern multiple regression is and how to use it for causal inference.
