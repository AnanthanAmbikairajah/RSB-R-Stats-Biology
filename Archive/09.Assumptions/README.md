# When assumptions are not met

Whenever we do statistical inference we rely on models that rely on specific assumptions. Checking assumptions is an essential part of statistical inference. But what should you do when assumptions are not met? Fortunately it is rarely necessary to trash everything. In this workshop we will discuss and practice some common strategies to deal with violated assumptions.
