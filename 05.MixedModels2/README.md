# Mixed models 2: Uncertainty in random effects

This session focuses on measuring uncertainty in random effect estimation. If time allows we will look at mixed models with random interactions.

You may want to check part 1, where we introduced the philosophy behind mixed models and how to use basic functions for lme4, but it is not necessary [https://github.com/timotheenivalis/RSB-R-Stats-Biology/blob/master/03.MixedModels/](https://github.com/timotheenivalis/RSB-R-Stats-Biology/blob/master/03.MixedModels/).
