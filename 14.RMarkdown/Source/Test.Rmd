## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r }
x1 <- rnorm(200)
x2 <- x1 +rnorm(200)
y <- 1 + x1 +rnorm(200)
summary(lm(y ~ x2))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
data(cars)
knitr::kable(x = head(cars), caption = "A knitr kable table")
```


## Linear regression {.tabset}

### Simple
A simple regression measures total associations
```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x2))
```

### Multiple
A multiple regression measures direct associations, corrected for indirect associations.
```{r}
summary(lm(y ~ x1+x2))
```
