# Mixed models part 2: practice and random covariates

In this workshop we will:
* practice interpreting and visualising results from random intercept models
* introduce more flexible mixed models where random effects are not only on the intercept but also on covariates (you may have heard of that as "random regression", "random interaction", random slope"...)
* practice with real data sets using lme4


Data for exercises will appear here on Friday 17
