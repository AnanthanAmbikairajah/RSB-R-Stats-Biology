# Make your own functions in R 

Because the ANU campus is closed I made a standalone pdf tutorial for this topic. In this tutorial you will learn:
* What is a function in R.
* Why it is useful to make your own functions.
* How to make a function.

If you have any trouble going through this tutorial you can chat about it on Slack ( rsb-r-stats-biology.slack.com , if you are not a member but
would like to be, drop me an email at [timotheebonnetc@gmail.com](mailto:timotheebonnetc@gmail.com)).
If you would like to receive credit through the COS Career Development Framework program I need you to complete three exercises of your choice. Send me your answers via Slack or email. It does not have to be correct on the first try and you are welcome to get in touch if you are completely stuck. I will provide feedback to help you complete exercises you want to do.
