# Generalized Linear Models 1: Logistic regression

In this session we will discuss what are Generalized Linear Models and practice the special case of logistic regression. 

Exercises will cover:

* Fitting and interpreting a simple logistic regression with the function glm() in R
* Producing model predictions for logistic regression
* Clustering predictions and assessing their performance
* Random effect and repeatability for a logistic regression
